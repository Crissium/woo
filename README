# Description
This is a crudely made two-player Connect-5 (also known as five-in-a-row, or Gomoko in Japanese) game with alpha-beta pruning.

# Controls
Z: undo last two moves
R: restart game
A: Let AI make a move for you
Num 1-6: set AI search depth

# Build
```
$ make
# make install # install with this command
```

This game depends on SFML 2.5 and you need a C++17-compliant compiler to build (not necessarily Clang as in my Makefile).

Note: The paths of the font file and images used for rendering is hard-coded.

# Warning
This is written for my C++ coursework assignment. Do not simply clone and pass it off as your own!
