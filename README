# Description
This is a crudely made Connect-5 (also known as Gomoko in Japanese) game with alpha-beta pruning.

# Build
```
make
```
This game depends on SFML 2.5 and you need a C++17-compliant compiler to build (not necessarily Clang as in my Makefile).

Note: The path of the font file used for rendering text is hard-coded. Modify if necessary!

# Warning
This is written for my C++ coursework assignment. Do not simply clone and pass it off as your own!
